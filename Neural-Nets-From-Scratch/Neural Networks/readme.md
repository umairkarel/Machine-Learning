# Neural Networks From Scartch

## Implementing a Neural Network From Complete Scratch

here i've implemented a neural network without using any ml-library (except numpy)
and just python Classes.

### Basics Overview of the Network.
* The network class takes in the 3 inputs as no. of input nodes, hidden nodes and  output nodes.
* The Model uses **Sigmoid Activation Function** for neuron activation.
* **Gardient Descent** is used for Optimization.

Here, the version1 program uses only one hidden layer, But in version2 i've improved the code so that you add **n** hidden layers to the network.
